## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Rebuild frontend in Next.js instead of enhancing Streamlit for full design control and professional UI
- Separate frontend/backend architecture for better separation of concerns and scalability
- PostgreSQL for persistence with industry standard support for complex queries
- Keep existing AI logic/prompts and optimize dynamically rather than rebuild from scratch
- Team-only auth for v1 to simplify scope (client access deferred to future)

**From 01-01 execution:**
- Use port 5433 for PostgreSQL (5432 occupied by other project)
- Async-only SQLAlchemy (no sync fallback)
- Pydantic Settings for centralized configuration
- expire_on_commit=False for async SQLAlchemy sessions

**From 01-02 execution:**
- Use Argon2 for password hashing (more secure than bcrypt)
- Implement Row-Level Security at database layer for defense-in-depth
- First user automatically becomes admin (simplifies initial setup)
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration (balances security and UX)
- OAuth2 password flow for standard authentication pattern
- Two RLS policies: user_isolation_policy + user_signup_policy for auth-less signup

**From 01-03 execution:**
- Use jose library for JWT operations (Next.js compatible, ESM-native)
- Server Actions with useActionState pattern for form handling
- React cache() for Data Access Layer request deduplication
- 7-day session cookie expiration with httpOnly and sameSite=lax
- OAuth2PasswordRequestForm format for login (username field = email)
- Optimistic middleware + Server Component verification pattern

**From 01-04 execution:**
- Singleton pattern for app_settings table (single row with id=1)
- Public endpoint for has-api-key check (enables frontend setup flow)
- API key stored plaintext for v1 (encryption deferred to future)
- Idempotent seed script that skips existing data
- getAdmin() DAL function redirects non-admins to dashboard with error

**From 01-05 execution:**
- Dual-cookie architecture: session cookie for frontend userId lookup, access_token cookie for backend API authorization
- Decode JWT without verification in auth actions (safe since just received from trusted backend)
- Both cookies use identical security settings (httpOnly, secure in prod, sameSite lax, 7 days)
- DAL uses getAccessToken() to send backend JWT in Authorization header

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 4 (AI Generation):** May need research for LangChain prompt engineering patterns specific to product content domain and OpenAI model selection for quality/cost optimization.

**Phase 6 (Smart Regeneration):** May need research for feedback learning techniques and refinement loop implementations.

### Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 1 COMPLETE AND VERIFIED ✓**
- ✅ User can sign up with email and password
- ✅ User can log in and remain authenticated across browser sessions
- ✅ User can log out from any page
- ✅ Authentication persists across browser refresh without re-login
- ✅ OpenAI API key is configured and stored securely per application instance
- ✅ Database enforces row-level security to prevent cross-tenant data access
- Verification: 6/6 success criteria passed (100%)
- Dev environment fully automated with seed script
- Dual-cookie architecture working correctly

**Phase 2 (Client Management) ready to plan:**
- Authentication foundation solid and verified
- Backend API infrastructure complete
- Admin authentication and authorization working
- Settings storage pattern established
- Dev environment provides instant testing capability
